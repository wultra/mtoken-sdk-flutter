# Server Error Handling

When the request fails on the server, it can return a known error for you to interpret to the user and use to log it
for better error reporting.

Such errors are represented by the `WMTResponseError` class, which contains the `code` and `message` properties and can be
found inside the `responseError` property of the `WMTException` class.

## Example error handling

```dart
// Approve operation with a password
Future<void> approve(WMTOnlineOperation operation, PowerAuthPassword password) async {
  try {
    final auth = PowerAuthAuthentication.password(password);
    await mtoken.operations.authorize(operation, auth);
  } on WMTException catch (e) {
    // process server error, if available
    print("Error: ${e.responseError?.message} (code: ${e.responseError?.code})");
  } catch (e) {
    // unexpected failure
  }
}
```

## Known API Error codes
