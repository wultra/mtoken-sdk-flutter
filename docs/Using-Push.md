## Introduction
<!-- end -->

`WMTPush` is responsible for registering the device for the push notifications about the operations that are tied to the current `PowerAuth` activation. For example, a push notification is received when a new operation is created.

Note: Before using `WMTPush`, you need to have a `PowerAuth` object available and initialized with a valid activation. Without a valid `PowerAuth` activation, the service will return an error.

Note: `WMTPush` only registers the device to receive push notifications, it does not process them - you need to handle that by yourself.
<!-- end -->

`WMTPush` communicates with the [Mobile Token API](https://developers.wultra.com/components/enrollment-server/develop/documentation/Mobile-Token-API).

## Getting an Instance

The instance of the `WMTPush` can be accessed after creating the main object of the SDK:

```dart
final mtoken = powerAuthInstance.createMobileToken();
final push = mtoken.push;
```

## Registering to Push Notifications Example

```dart
String token; // Push token from the platform (e.g. Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification service)

// for the sake of the exaple, we assume the token is for FCM
final data = WMTPushPlatform.fcm(token);
await mtoken.push.register(data);
```

<!-- begin box warning -->
If you're using an older PowerAuth server version 1.9, you need to setup the platform object to support legacy push registration with:
```dart
final data = WMTPushPlatform.fcm(token).supportLegacyServer();
```
